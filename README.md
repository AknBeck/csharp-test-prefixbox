# Java Test

-	The available time is 60 minutes
- The test is designed in a way that 60 minutes is not really enough to solve everything. Try to solve as much as you can though.
-	You might not use any kind of help(internet, other people, etc..)
- You might not ask questions during the test

## Tips and tricks

- Write your answer after the questions.
- For programming tasks, use the formatting syntax of the markdown language, for example for C# code:
```text
  `` `csharp
  Your C# code should come here
  `` ` 
```
-	Before starting to write anything you should read through all the questions.

### Programming tasks
- **You must not use an IDE**
- These exercises worth the most points
- You don't need to handle every edge case
- It doesn't matter if the program is not correct syntactically, the structure is the important part. You might also write pseudo code.

### Short questions
- You don't have too much time, short straightforward answers are expected
- The web questions are extra, not a priority

## Workflow

- Fork this repository under your own account
- Clone the forked repository to your computer
- All your answers and solutions should go in this repository
- **You might only push your solutions after the end of the test**
